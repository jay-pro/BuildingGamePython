#4. Keep the game running until the game is over
game_over = False

#5. Apply tries to the players to use to try to win
tries = 6

#6. Save the game shapes in hangman_lifr.py filr and import those shapes from this file.
from hangman_life import game_name
print(game_name)

#7. Test the code you written until now using Python print functions
print(f'The word you guessed is {guessing_word}')

#8. Create a list contains six '_' underscores to store and save the right letter guesed by the players of the random word
result = []

#9. Iterate over the players input
for _ in range(word_letters):

#13. The players lose a try if they guessed wrong letter
